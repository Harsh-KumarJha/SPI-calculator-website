A basic Semester Performance Index Calculator for my institute for the 5th semester students.
This tool helped different students of different branches to quickly analyse and calculate their SPI for the semester with accuracy.
With a pretty good response which can be seen with the analytics shared via google analytics tag which was linked to my page.

This also served as a pseudo calculator which helped the students who could not pass a subject to assess their SPI ; So that they can analyse how much they are scoring in present and what can they expect after improving in supplementary exam.
